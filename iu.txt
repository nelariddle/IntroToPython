Indiana University Bloomington (IU Bloomington, Indiana University, IU, or simply Indiana) is a public research university in Bloomington, Indiana. It is the flagship campus of Indiana University and its largest campus with over 40,000 students.[8][9]

Indiana University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".[10] Its schools and programs include the Jacobs School of Music, the Kelley School of Business, and the Maurer School of Law.[11]

The university houses more than 750 student organizations on campus and with around 17 percent of undergraduates joining the Greek system.[12] Indiana athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Indiana Hoosiers. The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Since it does not have a mascot, all teams are known simply as "Hoosiers."

History
Early years
Indiana's state government in Corydon established Indiana University on January 20, 1820, as the "State Seminary."[13] Construction began in 1822 at what is now called Seminary Square Park near the intersection of Second Street and College Avenue. Classes began on April 4, 1825.[14] The first professor was Baynard Rush Hall, a Presbyterian minister who taught all of the classes in 1825–27. In the first year, he taught twelve students and was paid $250. Hall was a classicist who focused on Greek and Latin and believed that the study of classical philosophy and languages formed the basis of the best education.[15] The first class graduated in 1830. From 1820 to 1889 a legal-political battle was fought between IU and Vincennes University as to which was the legitimate state university.[16][17]

The Sample Gates
The Sample Gates, the main entrance to the Indiana University Bloomington Campus
In 1829, Andrew Wylie became the first president, serving until his death in 1851. The school's name was changed to "Indiana College" in 1829, and to "Indiana University" in 1838.[18] Wylie and David Maxwell, president of the board of trustees, were devout Presbyterians. They spoke of the nonsectarian status of the school but generally hired fellow Presbyterians. Presidents and professors were expected to set a moral example for their charges. After six ministers in a row, the first non-clergyman to become president was the young biology professor David Starr Jordan, in 1885.[19] Jordan followed Baptist theologian Lemuel Moss, who resigned after a scandal broke regarding his involvement with a female professor.

Jordan (president 1884–1891) improved the university's finances and public image, doubled its enrollment, and instituted an elective system along the lines of his alma mater, Cornell University.[20] Jordan became president of Stanford University in June 1891.[21]

The growth of the institution was slow. In 1851, IU had nearly a hundred students and seven professors. IU admitted its first woman student, Sarah Parke Morrison, in 1867, making IU the fourth public university to admit women on an equal basis with men.[citation needed]Morrison went on to become the first female professor at IU in 1873.[citation needed]

Mathematician Joseph Swain was IU's first Hoosier-born president, 1893 to 1902. He established Kirkwood Hall in 1894; a gymnasium for men in 1896, which later was named Assembly Hall; and Kirkwood Observatory in 1900. He began construction for Science Hall in 1901. During his presidency, student enrollment increased from 524 to 1,285.[22][23]


Morrison Hall in June 1942
In 1883, IU awarded its first PhD and played its first intercollegiate sport (baseball), prefiguring the school's future status as a major research institution and a power in collegiate athletics. But another incident that year was of more immediate concern: the original campus in Seminary Square burned to the ground. The college was rebuilt between 1884 and 1908 at the far eastern edge of Bloomington. (Today, the city has expanded eastward, and the "new" campus is once again in the midst of the city.) One challenge was that Bloomington's limited water supply was inadequate for its population of 12,000 and could not handle university expansion. The university commissioned a study that led to building a reservoir for its use.[24]

20th century
In 1902, IU enrolled 1203 undergraduates; all but 65 were Hoosiers. There were 82 graduate students including ten from out-of-state. The curriculum emphasized the classics, as befitted a gentleman, and stood in contrast to the service-oriented curriculum at Purdue University, which presented itself as of direct benefit to farmers, industrialists, and businessmen.[25]

The first extension office of IU was opened in Indianapolis in 1916. In 1920/1921 the School of Music and the School of Commerce and Finance (what later became the Kelley School of Business) were opened. In the 1940s Indiana University opened extension campuses in Kokomo and Fort Wayne. The Kinsey Institute for sexual research was established in 1945.

During the Great Depression, Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship of its young president Herman Wells. He collaborated with Frederick L. Hovde, the president of Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built one of the finest facilities in the country. He added matching funds from the state legislature and opened a full-scale fund-raising campaign among alumni and the business community. In 1942, Wells reported that "The past five years have been the greatest single period of expansion in the physical plant of the University in its entire history. In this period 15 new buildings have been constructed.[26][27]

In 1960, the IU student body elected Thomas Atkins, an African-American from Elkhart, Indiana, to the position of president of the student body. A throng of white students protested the result by parading around campus waving Confederate flags and allegedly blamed Atkins' victory on a "bunch of beatniks." When the protesters approached the female dormitory on campus, they were met with "a barrage of cosmetic bottles, old shoes, and other objects."[28]

Campus
The Indiana University Bloomington campus of 1,933 acres (7.82 km2) includes abundant green space and historic buildings dating to the university's reconstruction in the late nineteenth century. The campus rests on a bed of Indiana Limestone, specifically Salem Limestone and Harrodsburg Limestone, with outcroppings of St. Louis Limestone.

The "Campus River" is a stream flowing through the center of campus. A section of Bloomington's Clear Creek,[29] it was formerly named the "Jordan River" after David Starr Jordan, Darwinist, ichthyologist, president of IU, and later, of Stanford University.[30] The name was changed, along with several campus buildings, in 2020 by the IU trustees due to Jordan's support of eugenics becoming widely known.[31]

Bloomington was ranked 5th best city for educated millennials by Business Insider.[32] College Ranker listed Bloomington as #6 Best College Town to Live in Forever.[33]

Many of the campus's buildings, especially the older central buildings, are made from Indiana Limestone quarried locally. The Works Progress Administration built much of the campus's core during the Great Depression. Many of the campus's buildings were built and most of its land acquired during the 1950s and 1960s when first soldiers attending under the GI Bill and then the baby boom swelled the university's enrollment from 5,403 in 1940 to 30,368 in 1970. Some buildings on campus underwent similar expansion. As additions were constructed by building onto the outside of existing buildings, exterior surfaces were incorporated into their new interiors, making this expansion visible in the affected buildings' architecture. The Chemistry and Biology buildings serve as examples, where two of the interior walls of the latter's library were clearly constructed as limestone exteriors. The Bryan House is the traditional on-campus home of the university president.

Nine of the oldest buildings are included in a national historic district known as The Old Crescent. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[34] They are the Collegiate Gothic style Student Service Building (1906–1908); Indiana University Museum (1905); Richardsonian Romanesque style Maxwell Building (1890, 1907–1908); Owen Hall (1885); Wylie Hall (1885); Kirkwood Hall (1895); Lindley Hall (1903); Gothic Revival style Rose Well House (1908); and Kirkwood Observatory (1900).[35]

The Sample Gates serve as the entryway to Indiana University's campus and The Old Crescent. It is positioned between Franklin Hall and Bryan Hall.[36] After several failed attempts to create an arched entrance to campus, in 1987, Edson Sample provided funding to build the archway based on the 1961 design proposed by Eggers & Higgins.[37]

The Indiana University Cinema opened in January 2011 in the former University Theatre building, which was built in the 1930s.

The Bloomington campus also has a biology research greenhouse in the Biology Building that is open to the public, one of the highlights of which is a corpse flower (Amorphophallus titanum) named Wally.[38][39] Also on campus, the Kirkwood Observatory is open to the public one day a week.

The 1979 movie Breaking Away was filmed on location in Bloomington and the IU campus. It also featured a reenactment of the annual Little 500 bicycle race. The IU campus also has trails that many utilize for biking and running. The trails in Bloomington and nearby areas total nearly 1,200 miles (1,900 km).

Indiana Memorial Union

The over 500,000-square-foot (46,000 m2) Indiana Memorial Union (IMU) is the second-largest student union in the world. In addition to stores and restaurants, it features an eight-story student activities tower (home to the Indiana University Student Association, Indiana Memorial Union Board, and a variety of other student organizations), a 189-room hotel, a 400-seat theatre, a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) Alumni Hall, 50,000 square feet (4,600 m2) of meeting space, and a bowling alley. The IMU houses an outstanding collection of Indiana art including artists from Brown County, the Hoosier Group, Richmond Group and others. This collection is the largest public collection of art outside of a museum.

Indiana University's athletic facilities are located on campus and are grouped in between East 17th Street, Dunn Street and the IN-45/IN-46 bypass. In the 17,000-seat Assembly Hall (home to the IU NCAA basketball team), there are five NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship banners on display. Cook Hall, Memorial Stadium, Mellencamp Pavilion, the Gladstein Fieldhouse, the IU Tennis Center, the Billy Hayes Track and Bill Armstrong Stadium are all also located within the complex.

Indiana University Auditorium
Indiana University Auditorium (IU Auditorium), is a 3,200 seat performing arts venue located at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.[40][41] It is situated in IU's Fine Arts Plaza alongside the Lilly Library and the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design.[42]

Construction on IU Auditorium began in 1939 as a part of the Federal Works Agency Projects.[43] IU Auditorium officially opened its doors March 22, 1941.[44]

IU Auditorium's Hall of Murals is the home of the Indiana Murals, created by American artist Thomas Hart Benton. 16 of the 22 total panels created are housed at the auditorium.[45]

Today, IU Auditorium presents Broadway touring acts, popular musical artists, comedians, classical musicians and more.[46]

Department of Chemistry

This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2022)
The Chemistry Department has had a history at Indiana University since the early days of the institution. Chemistry courses were first added to the curriculum in 1829 by Andrew Wylie, IU president at the time (1829–1851).[47] The first degrees in chemistry were awarded in 1890. The graduate school at Indiana University was not formally established until 1904 but not soon after, a plan for graduate work in chemistry was underway. However, the first PhD in chemistry was not granted until 1921.[48] In 1931, the construction of a new facility explicitly for chemistry began which led to major growth within the department. Some of the department's most acclaimed and prolific faculty came to the university during this time.[according to whom?] A major staple to the department is the famous Sweetheart tree [49] that has stood outside the Chemistry Building since it was built in 1931. Even when a major addition to the building was made in the 1980s, architects decided to preserve the beloved tree and build around it. In the spring of 2018 the university announced the famous sweetheart tree was dying, and removal was scheduled to begin on April 11.

Libraries

Herman B Wells Library, seen from IU Arboretum
The Indiana University Bloomington Library System supports over twenty libraries and provides access to more than 9.9 million books, 800 databases, 60,000 electronic journal titles, and 815,000 ebooks.[50] The system is the 14th largest library in North America by volumes held.[51]

Herman B Wells Library
IU's Herman B Wells Library holds more than 4.6 million volumes.[52] Before a ceremony in June 2005, when it was renamed for IU's former president and chancellor, this building was simply called the Main Library.[53] The architectural firm Eggers & Higgins designed the largely windowless, limestone paneled library, whose construction began in 1966 and was completed in 1969.[54] The building contains eleven floors in the East Tower (research collection) and five floors in the West Tower (the undergraduate core collection). In 2014 the first floors of both towers were renovated and reintroduced as the Learning Commons and Scholars' Commons. The library is also home to Indiana University Press and the University Graduate School. It is the former home of the Information and Library Science Department, which is now hosted by Luddy Hall.

An oft-repeated urban legend holds that the library is sinking because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. An article in the Indiana Daily Student newspaper debunks this myth, stating, among other things, that the building rests on a 94 ft (28.6 m) thick limestone bedrock.[55]

The Black Film Center/Archive (BFC/A), located at Indiana University, was "established in 1981 as a repository of films and related materials by and about African Americans."[57] Professor Phyllis R. Klotman founded the repository when it became apparent that rare and valuable films created by and about African Americans were being lost due to lack of preservation and inadequate resources.[58]

The BFC/A has an extensive collection that includes films on various physical media, posters of numerous sizes for films distributed throughout the world, photographs and film stills, and manuscripts of filmmakers and scholars. Although the materials are not available for circulation or distribution, the archive has rooms for viewing films and utilizing materials.

Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive
The Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive (IULMIA) is one of the largest repositories for educational film and video in the United States.[59][non-primary source needed] Founded in 2009, IULMIA contains over 100,000 items spanning over 80 years of audiovisual history.[60][61] Highlights of its holdings include a collection of over 200 film cameras and projectors, more than 80,000 commercials from the Clio Awards, and approximately 50,000 educational films that Indiana University circulated to classrooms nationwide during the 20th century.[61][62][63]

In 2012, the Moving Image Archive was accepted as a member of the International Federation of Film Archives.[64]

The Lilly Library is one of the largest rare book and manuscript libraries in the United States. [non-primary source needed] Founded in 1960 with the collection of Josiah K. Lilly Jr., of Eli Lilly and Company in Indianapolis, the library now contains approximately 400,000 rare books, 6.5 million manuscripts, and 100,000 pieces of sheet music.[65] The library's holdings are particularly strong in British and American history and literature, religious texts, Latin Americana, medicine and science, food and drink, children's literature, fine printing and binding, popular music, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, and early printing. Notable items in the library's collections include the New Testament of the Gutenberg Bible, a first edition copy of the Book of Mormon, the first printed collection of Shakespeare's works, a pair of the Spock's ears worn by Leonard Nimoy in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Audubon's Birds of America, one of 25 extant copies of the "First Printing of the Declaration of Independence" (also known as the "Dunlap Broadside") that was printed in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, George Washington's letter accepting the presidency of the United States, Abraham Lincoln's desk from his law office, a leaf from the famous, Abraham Lincoln "Sum Book" c. 1824–1826, Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son, the manuscripts of Robert Burns's "Auld Lang Syne", the Boxer Codex, annotated production scripts for Star Trek, J. M. Synge's The Playboy of the Western World, and J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, and typescripts of many of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. The library also owns the papers of Hollywood directors Orson Welles and John Ford, the poets Sylvia Plath and Ezra Pound, and authors Edith Wharton, Max Eastman and Upton Sinclair. The library is also home to four Academy Awards, donated by alumni. In 2006, the library received a collection of 30,000 mechanical puzzles from Jerry Slocum. The collection will be on permanent display. Special permission is not required to use the collections, and the library has several exhibition galleries that are open to the public.

Within the Lilly Library is the Ruth E. Adomeit collection of miniature books, one of the world's largest.[66] Among the collection are rare miniature books such as "From Morn Till Eve", a miniature book that presents biblical quotations in a devotional form, with one phrase for each morning and evening of a month. The Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) had listed that, "the only known copy as being in the collection of famed miniature book collector Ruth E. Adomeit",[67] which is now in the Lilly Library.

Fine Arts Library
IU's first Fine Arts Library was established in the late 1930s as part of the Departmental office on the second floor, east wing of the University Library which was then in Franklin Hall. In 1941, two important events occurred: art historian Henry Radford Hope became chairman of the Fine Arts Department in the Fall and the Fine Arts Center was created by remodeling Mitchell Hall Annex. The Fine Arts Library moved into IU Art Museum designed by I.M. Pei in August 1981. This location was closed for renovations to the museum in spring 2017. Most fine arts materials are currently located on the 9th floor of the Herman B Wells Library with the remaining items being located towards the back of the 10th floor.[68]

William and Gayle Cook Music Library
The William and Gayle Cook Music Library, recognized as one of the largest academic music libraries in the world, serves the Jacobs School of Music and the Bloomington Campus of Indiana University. [non-primary source needed] It occupies a four-floor, 55,000 square-foot facility in a wing of the Bess Meshulam Simon Music Library and Recital Center, dedicated in November 1995. The collection comprises over 700,000 cataloged items on 56,733 linear feet of shelves.

The Cook Music Library holds many special collections, including audio and print collections. One notable collection contains items from Leonard Bernstein's compositional studio, including items such as clothing, furniture, recordings, books, and awards.[69]

Residence hall libraries
Residence hall library programs began in the 1930s at Harvard University. By 1978, there were twenty-one institutions with residential library systems.[70] Today, Indiana University has only one of two residential library programs that still operates. Additionally, Indiana University has continued to expand its residential library system, adding the most recent branch in 2017. As of 2018 there were fourteen library branches: Briscoe, Campus View Apartments, Collins LLC, Eigenmann, Forest, Foster, McNutt, Read, Spruce, Teter, Union Street Center, Wells Quad, Wilkie, and Wright.[71] The libraries are open daily while classes are in session. Previously, half of the branches offered only DVDs and CDs. In 2018, the decision was made to have all library branches offer books in addition to movies and games. The libraries hire graduate students in Indiana University's Master of Library Science program to act as center supervisors, who lead a staff of seven student assistants in staffing the libraries each evening. New material is added to the libraries each week, and any student or staff member of Indiana University can check out material using their Crimson Card.

IU Art Museum
The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, formerly known as the Indiana University Art Museum,[72] was established in 1941 and has occupied a building designed by the world-renowned architecture firm I.M. Pei and Partners since 1982. The museum houses a collection of over 40,000 objects and includes works by Claude Monet, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Jackson Pollock. The museum has particular strengths in the art of Africa, Oceania, the Americas, Ancient Greece and Rome, and European Modernism. It also holds a substantial collection of works on paper (prints, drawings, and photographs). The museum routinely has been ranked among the best university art museums in the United States.[73]

Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology
The IU Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (formerly the Mathers Museum of World Cultures and the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology) consist of an estimated 5 million archaeological artifacts, 30,000 ethnographic objects, 20,000 photographs, and supporting library and archive. The collections represent cultures from each of the world's inhabited continents. These materials have been collected and curated to serve the museum's primary mission as a teaching museum within a university setting. The ethnology collections' strengths include traditional musical instruments, photographs of Native Americans and the Bloomington community, Inupiaq and Yupik Eskimo materials, and Pawnee material culture, among others. The archaeology collections piece together the material remains of cultures from the earliest occupations of North American through to the modern period.

Grunwald Gallery of Art
The Grunwald Gallery of Art, a contemporary art museum hosted by the university.[74] The gallery was established in 1983 as the School of Fina Arts Gallery (SoFA Gallery) in what was formerly University's art museum space when that museum relocated to a new building.[75] The museum exhibits experimental works by emerging and established artists as well as works by faculty and students within the Department of Studio Art. It is located at 1201 East 7th Street. It was named in honor of Indiana University alumnus John A. Grunwald in 2011.[76] He was born in Hungary in 1935, survived the Holocaust, emigrated to the United States in 1950, and graduated with a degree in economics in 1956 from Indiana University where he met his wife Rita.[74] In 2017, the art museum hosted an exhibition on the history of tattoo artistry in Indiana.[77]

Indiana Memorial Union
The Indiana Memorial Union, in addition to hosting many events, holds the largest public collection of art outside a museum. The artwork within the building ranges from priceless sculptures to paintings.

Main article: Indiana University School of Informatics
Lindley Hall
Lindley Hall, former home of the Department of Computer Science
In 1999, the Indiana University School of Informatics was established as an environment for research professors and students to develop new uses for information technology to solve specific problems in areas as diverse as biology, fine arts, and economics.[121] This was the first school of Informatics established in the United States. Informatics is also interested in "how people transform technology, and how technology transforms us."[122] In 2005 the Department of Computer Science moved from the College of Arts and Sciences to the School of Informatics, prompting the school to expand its name to "School of Informatics and Computing".[123] This move merged several faculty, bringing the total core faculty to over 100. In 2015, Indiana University submitted a proposal to the Indiana Commission for Higher Education for the establishment of an Engineering program.[124] Purdue University attempted to block the proposal, but the commission shot them down, passing the proposal unanimously.[125] Following approval, in 2016 the new Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering was established as a part of the School of Informatics and Computing, and its name was again changed, this time to the "School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering," commonly referred to as SICE.[126] Shortly after, IU approved the construction of a $39.8 million new facility to house the rechristened school, named Luddy Hall, after alumnus, Fred Luddy.[127] Luddy Hall opened its doors in January 2018. Informatics also has strong ties with the Media School, Jacobs School of Music, and the Cognitive Science program.

The School is one of a handful that offers degrees in Human-Computer Interaction.[128] The School offers master's degrees in Human-Computer Interaction Design, Music Informatics, Bioinformatics, Chemical Informatics, Security Informatics, Intelligent Systems Engineering, Computer Science, and PhD degrees in Computer Science, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems Engineering. Specialization areas for the PhD in Computer Science include artificial intelligence, databases, distributed systems, formal methods, high-performance computing, programming languages, and security. The Informatics PhD program offers tracks in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, complex systems, human-computer interaction design, logic and mathematical foundations of informatics, music informatics, security informatics, and social informatics.

The School has four departments, namely, Informatics, Intelligent Systems Engineering, Computer Science, and Information and Library Science. The IU Department of Information and Library Science (ILS) was ranked by U.S. News & World Report in 2016 as the 8th best program in the nation.[119] It has also been ranked number 1 in scholarly productivity by a 2006 study published in the journal Library & Information Science Research.[129] ILS is housed on the ground floor of the Wells Library's Western Tower. In April 2012, what was formerly known as the School of Library and Information Science and IU's School of Informatics and Computing began a discussion on a possible merger of the two schools. Indiana University Board of Trustees approved the merger on October 22, 2012. Effective from July 1, 2013, IU School of Informatics and School of Library and Information and Science will merge into a single school to be called the IU School of Informatics and Computing.[130]

O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs
Main article: O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs
The O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs (or SPEA) is the largest school of its kind in the United States. Founded in 1972, SPEA is known for its distinctive interdisciplinary approach. It brings together the social, natural, behavioral, and administrative sciences in one faculty. SPEA has a sister "core" campus at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (or IUPUI) and an affiliate program is operated at Indiana University's Gary campus.

Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington
Main article: Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington
Established in 2012[134] the school and programs have grown to encompass a broad spectrum of academic interests and professional fields. The school was founded in 1946 as the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation. It transitioned into the School of Public Health-Bloomington and was renamed in September 2012.[135][136] It was accredited by the Council on Education in Public Health in June 2015.[137]

The school has nearly 3,000 students and 24,000 living alumni, with undergraduate and advanced degree programs offered through five academic departments: Applied Health Science, Environmental Health, Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Kinesiology, and Recreation, Park, & Tourism Studies.[138] The Division of Campus Recreational Sports within the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington provides sport and fitness opportunities for the IU community and the public.[139]

The school has numerous centers, institutes, and specialized laboratories, including the Center for Sexual Health Promotion, the Indiana Prevention Resource Center, the National Center on Accessibility, the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention, among others.[140]

The school's resources include more than 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) of research and teaching laboratories, and nearly 275,000 square feet (25,500 m2) of indoor and outdoor sport and fitness facilities, including recreation centers, aquatics centers, and acreage that includes Bradford Woods.

School of Social Work
The Indiana University School of Social Work was founded in 1911 as the Department of Social Service, thus making it the oldest professional social work education program begun and still functioning as a part of a university. In July 2007, the Indiana University Division of Labor Studies merged with the School of Social Work.[141]

Department of Labor Studies: the Department of Labor Studies, a unit housed within the School of Social Work, was founded in the 1940s during the tenure of Herman B Wells in response to the growing role of organized labor in American society. Today, the Division is one of only several degree-granting programs in the nation for the area of labor studies or industrial relations. Notable faculty in recent years have included Leonard Page, General Counsel for the National Labor Relations Board during the Clinton Administration, and labor economist/author Michael Yates.
School of Medicine–Bloomington
Main article: Indiana University School of Medicine
The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) traces its roots to Bloomington, being founded there in 1903 by president William Lowe Bryan. Initially, only the first two years of medical education were offered there. Students were required to take the final two years at a separate, private medical school in Indianapolis, the State College of Physicians and Surgeons, with a doctor of medicine degree conferred by IU at the end of their education.[142] The School of Medicine's main campus moved to Indianapolis in 1908 following the resolution of a dispute with the School of Medicine of Purdue University over which school had the legal authority to establish a medical school there.[142] After this, students could complete all four years at the main campus in Indianapolis or remain in Bloomington for their first two years.[142]

The Bloomington medical school building was constructed in 1937 using funds from the WPA.[143] In 1958 the VanNuys medical science building was completed in Indianapolis, and all medical education was moved there.[144] The Bloomington medical science building was thus renamed as Myers Hall, in honor of medical school dean Burton D. Myers.[145] Not wanting it to go unused, president Herman B. Wells established a program that combined the first two years of medical education with a master's or PhD.[146] About half of the Bloomington medical school faculty moved, with the remaining half forming the Department of Anatomy and Physiology at IU Bloomington.[146]

In the early 1960s, a projected shortage of American physicians spurred some state legislators to call for the creation of a second state medical school.[146] Rather than face competition, IU proposed the creation of a statewide medical school system under its control. Medical education thus resumed at Myers Hall. IU also launched pilot programs in 1968 at Purdue and the University of Notre Dame where students would complete the first two years of medical education before transferring to Indianapolis.[146] IU's proposal was accepted by the state legislature in 1971, and by 1981 eight regional campuses of IUSM were offering at least the first year of medical education. By 1990 every regional campus was offering the first two years, and because of Bloomington's resources, it was able to admit twice the number of students as the next largest regional site.[146]

In 2002 IUSM–Bloomington traded spaces with the Indiana Molecular Biology Institute in response to both institutions' growing needs, with the school relocating to a modified space in the basement of Jordan Hall, now known simply as the Biology Building.[145][147]

Due to another call for physicians in the early 2000s, IUSM began expanding medical instruction on its regional campuses to include all four years. By 2014 the process was complete.[146]

In 2021 IUSM–Bloomington, the Bloomington campuses of the School of Nursing and the School of Social Work, and the IU Bloomington Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences moved into the newly-constructed Health Sciences Building, a part of the Regional Academic Health Center (the RAHC, pronounced "rack").[146] The RAHC also houses IU Health Bloomington Hospital. The RAHC is located northeast of campus, at the corner of East Discovery Parkway and State Road 45.

School of Nursing
Main article: Indiana University School of Nursing
The Indiana University Training School for Nurses was established in Indianapolis in 1914 in conjunction with the establishment of the Robert W. Long Hospital and in association with the IU School of Medicine to offer training leading to a nursing diploma. It was renamed the IU School of Nursing in 1956.[148] In the 1930s a Division of Nursing Education under the IU School of Education was created on the Bloomington campus to offer additional training to nursing students seeking BS; an MS degree program was added in 1945.[149] Today, the School of Nursing is located at several of the IU campuses, with Indianapolis and Bloomington being the main locations. As of 2017 its degree programs include a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree, a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, and two doctoral degrees: Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Philosophy in nursing (PhD).[150]

The National League for Nursing has recognized the School as a Center of Excellence in two categories simultaneously for creating environments that: Promote the Pedagogical Expertise of Faculty and Creating Environments (effective 2006–22) and Advance the Science of Nursing Education (effective 2012–21).[151] The IU School of Nursing ranks eighth among public universities who receive funding from the National Institutes of Health. Almost forty percent of the baccalaureate-prepared professional nurses in Indiana graduate from the IU School of Nursing each year.[citation needed] In 2017 the U.S. News & World Report ranked the IU School of Nursing twenty-eighth for its master's degree program and twenty-third for its Doctor of Nursing Practice degree among U.S. colleges and universities; its online graduate program ranked thirty-ninth.[152]

School of Optometry

The Indiana University School of Optometry was founded in 1951. The school became a degree-granting institution of its own in 1975. Located at the southwest border of campus the Doctor of Optometry (OD) program admits on average 70–80 students per year.

The school operates a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) community eye care clinic in Bloomington and a clinic in Indianapolis. In addition to providing optometric education, the facility also houses the Borish Center for Ophthalmic Research, officially dedicated in October 1995. The Borish Center provides opportunities for undergraduate, professional, and graduate students to participate directly in vision research.

University Graduate School
In 2007–08, the Graduate and Professional Student Organization partnered with the Graduate to create the Emissaries for Graduate Student Diversity. Emissaries work either towards outreach and enrollment or retention and community building. Outreach and enrollment emissaries inform prospective students about opportunities at IU. They also help them navigate the admissions process. The retention and community building Emissaries act as mentors for current students.[153] The Graduate School has a separate student government (Graduate and Professional Student Government, or GPSG). They collaborate with faculty to help improve the quality of services offered to graduate students attending Indiana University.[154]

National team titles (now totaling 26; 25 NCAA, 1 AIAW) have been won in nine men's sports and one women's sport (tennis), topped by a record-setting six straight men's swimming & diving titles, eight men's soccer crowns and five titles in men's basketball. Indiana University's men's basketball team is one of the most decorated programs in the nation, having won five national championships. Indiana student-athletes have won 133 NCAA individual titles, including 79 in men's swimming and diving and 31 in men's track and field. Also, IU teams have won or shared 157 Big Ten Conference championships.

The IU athletics endowment is $42 million, the largest in the Big Ten.[155] The Varsity Club, which is the fundraising arm of the Athletics Department, drew a record $11.5 million in gifts and pledges in fiscal year 2004–05. Also, overall annual giving has increased by 8.3 percent in the last year and 44.8 percent in the last three years.

In addition to its tradition in intervarsity sports, IU also has many non-varsity sports. Hurling has also become more popular, with the Indiana University Hurling Club becoming the first American national champions in history.[156]
